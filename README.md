# Data Structures & Algorithms Implemented In C

This repository is for data structures and algorithms implemented in C.

The code is largely based off of the Udemy course [Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp) by Abdul Bari

The list of algorithms implemented are not extensive.

The goal of each data structure was to get basic creation, insertion, search, and deletion functionality implemented.
